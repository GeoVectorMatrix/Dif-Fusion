## Running the code

Run train_ddpm.py to train a diffusion model for infrared and visible images.

Run train_fusion_head.py to train the fusion model.

Run t_fusion.py to obtain the fused color images.

Please set paths to infrared and visible image folds in train_xxx.py its corresponding json files.
If there are trained models, set paths to these files in xxxx.json.
